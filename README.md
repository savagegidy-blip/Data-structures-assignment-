# Data Structure Classification Assignment

## Task 2: Data Structure Applications
* **Arrays:** Used in image processing and storing lookup tables because they allow fast access to elements.
* **Stacks:** Used in text editors for the "Undo" feature (LIFO) and in expression evaluation.
* **Queues:** Used in operating systems for task scheduling and printer buffers (FIFO).
* **Linked Lists:** Used in music players to create playlists (next/previous songs).

## Task 3: Real-World Examples
* **Google Maps:** Uses **Graphs** to represent road networks and find the shortest path between locations.
* **Web Browsers:** Use a **Stack** to store the history of visited pages for the "Back" button.
* **Social Media:** Facebook uses **Graphs** to manage user connections and "People You May Know" suggestions.

## Task 4: Integration within Systems
Data structures provide the physical organization of data in memory, while algorithms provide the step-by-step logic to process that data. Within a system, they work together to optimize performance, reduce memory usage, and ensure data can be retrieved or sorted quickly.
